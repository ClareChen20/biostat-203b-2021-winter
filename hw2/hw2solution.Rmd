Use tidyverse (ggpot2, dplyr) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat203b-2021winter.github.io/hw/hw1/hw1.html).

```{r}
system(str_c("tree -s -L 2 ", shQuote(mimic_path)), intern = TRUE)
```

## Q1. PhysioNet credential

At this moment, you should already get credentialed on the PhysioNet. Please include a screenshot of your `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v0.4)`.

### Solution:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Credential.jpg")
```

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

### Solution

```{r}
system.time(fread("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
```

```{r}
system.time(read_csv("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
system.time(read.csv("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
```
'fread' command was the quickest one, took about 5 seconds to complete; 
'read_csv' was also fairly quick, took about 4 seconds to read in the data;
'read.csv' behaved the worst, which took more than 1 minutes on my local computer 
and was even slower on the teaching server, so I set 'eval=false' for this one.

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

### Solution:

Read in 'icustays' data.
```{r}
icustays <- read_csv("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/icu/icustays.csv.gz") %>%
  print(width = Inf, n = 10)
```

- Check for numbers of unique 'stay_id': 69619
```{r}
icustays %>%
  distinct(stay_id) %>%
  nrow()
```

- Check for numbers of unique 'subject_id': 50048
```{r}
icustays %>%
  distinct(subject_id) %>%
  nrow()
```

- Length of ICU stays:

To make the graph more clear, logrithm transformation has been applied to the value of x: length of ICU stays.
```{r}
icustays %>%
  mutate(length = as.numeric(outtime - intime)) %>%
  select(length) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(length))) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', 
                 fill = 'lightblue', bins = 40) +
  xlab("Log of ICU stays") +
  ylab("Density")
```

We can use the data los given in the dataset directly:
```{r}
icustays %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = log(los)), bins = 40)
```

Note that the histograms from the above two methods are essentially the same.

- First ICU unit  
```{r}
icustays %>%
  select(first_careunit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = first_careunit)) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(fill = first_careunit)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

- last ICU unit  
```{r}
icustays %>%
  select(last_careunit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=last_careunit)) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(fill = last_careunit)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

### Solution

```{r}
admission <- read_csv("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core/admissions.csv.gz") %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

- admission year  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = admittime)) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue', bin = 30) +
  xlab("Admission Year") +
  ylab("Density")
```

- admission month  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = month(admittime))) +
  geom_bar(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue') +
  xlab("Admission Month") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 12, 1))
```


- admission month day  

Looks like there is a peak on 14th.
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = mday(admittime))) +
    geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue', bin = 5) +
    xlab("Admission Days") +
    ylab("Density") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 31, 5))
```

- admission week day  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = wday(admittime))) +
    geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue') +
    xlab("Admission Week Day") +
    ylab("Density") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 7, 1))
```

- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = hours(admittime))) +
    geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue') +
    xlab("Admission hour") +
    ylab("Density")
```


- number of deaths in each year  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = year(deathtime))) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'lightblue', bin = 30) +
  xlab("Admission Year") +
  ylab("Density")
```

- admission type  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = admission_type)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "yellow") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Admisison Type')
```

- number of admissions per patient  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
admission %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = count(hadm_id))) + 
    geom_histogram(position = "identity") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Number of admissions')
```

- admission location  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = admission_location)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "yellow") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Admisison Location')
```

- discharge location  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = discharge_location)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "yellow") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Discharge Location')
```

- insurance  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = insurance)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "purple") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Discharge Location')
```

- language  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = language)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "purple") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Discharge Location')
```

- martial status  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = marital_status)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "purple") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Discharge Location')
```

- ethnicity  
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = ethnicity)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "yellow") +
    scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) +
    labs(title = 'Discharge Location')
```

- death 
```{r}
admission %>%
  distinct(., subject_id, .keep = T) %>%
  ggplot(data = admission, mapping = aes(x = hospital_expire_flag)) + 
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "pink") +
    labs(title = 'Death in the hospital')
```

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 


## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

### Solution:
Read in the data:
```{r}
patients <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/patients.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

- `gender`  
Number of females: 200226
Number of males: 182994
We can conclude that the distribution of the gender in this dataset is fairly even.
```{r}
patients %>%
  filter(gender != 0) %>%
  select(gender) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gender)) +
    stat_count(position = "identity", color = "black", fill = "blue", bins = 30) +
    geom_density()
    theme_classic()

Female <- sum(patients$gender == 'F')
Male <- sum(patients$gender == 'M')
```

- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)
From the histogram, we can see that most of the patients had an anchor_age around 25, and there was another minor peak aroung the age of 55. Then the density gradually decreased as the anchor_age increasd.
```{r}
patients %>%
  filter(anchor_age != 0) %>%
  select(anchor_age) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), position = "identity", 
                 color = "black", fill = "blue") +
  geom_density()
  theme_classic()
```


## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, hematocrit, white blood cell count, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and lactate. Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

Following was the way to read in the file by subsetting the dataset.
```{r}
icustays_tble <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/icustays.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
  system.time(labevents_tble <-
    fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
      select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid","charttime", "valuenum"),
                  nThread = 4))
  labevents_tble %>%
    semi_join(icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
    fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
system.time(labevents_tble <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
labevents_tble %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

Read in the lab item dictionary
```{r}
dlabitems <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz')) %>%
  print (width = Inf)
```

Lab items that are related to creatinine:
```{r}
labitem <- 'creatinine'
creatinine_items <- dlabitems %>%
  filter(str_detect(label, regex(labitem, ignore_case = T))) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

Then find the most frequent lab items:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
labitems <- c("creatine", "postassium", "sodium", "chloride", 
             "bicarbonate", "hematocrit", "white blood cell",
             "glucose", "magnesium", "calcium", "lactate")
itemids <- rep(0, length(labitems))
i <- 1
for (labitem in labitems) {
  print(str_interp("search for ${labitem}"))
  itemid_list <- dlabitems %>%
    filter(str_detect(lable, regex(labitem, ignore_case = T))) %>%
    .$itemid
  itemid <- labevents_tble %>%
    filter(itemid %in% itemid_list) %>%
    count(itemid) %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    .$itemid
  itemid[i] <- itemid
  i <- i+1
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
labitem_itemid <- tibble (itemid = itemids, labitem = labitems) %>%
  print(width = Width)
```

Finally, filter the rows that only contains these items:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
labevents_tble <- labevents_tble %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(itemid %in% labitem_itemid$itemid) %>%
  mutate(charttime = ymd_hms(charttime)) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```


## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
transactFile <- str_c(mimic_path,"/icu/chartevents.csv.gz")
chunkSize <- 1000
con <- file(description= transactFile, open="r")
data <- read.table(con, nrows=chunkSize, header=T, fill=TRUE, sep=",")
close(con)
```


## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission
